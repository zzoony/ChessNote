# Last Move Highlight Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the last move highlight feature that visually indicates the previous move by highlighting both the origin and destination squares with a light orange color (#ffcc80).

## Technical Implementation

### 1. GameContext Updates (/src/context/GameContext.tsx)
- Added `lastMove: { from: string; to: string } | null` to `GameContextType` interface
- Added `lastMove` computation using `React.useMemo` to calculate the last move from `gameState.moves`
- Updated the provider value to include `lastMove`

### 2. Square Component Updates (/src/components/ChessBoard/Square.tsx)
- Added `isLastMoveSquare?: boolean` prop to `SquareProps` interface
- Updated component to accept the new prop with default value `false`
- Enhanced `getBackgroundColor()` function to handle last move highlighting:
  - Priority order: Selected (yellow) > Possible move capture (green) > Possible move (blue) > Last move (orange) > Default

### 3. ChessBoard Component Updates (/src/components/ChessBoard/ChessBoard.tsx)
- Added `lastMove` to the destructured context values from `useGame()`
- Updated `renderBoard()` to calculate `isLastMoveSquare` for each square
- Logic: `isLastMoveSquare = lastMove ? (square === lastMove.from || square === lastMove.to) : false`
- Passed `isLastMoveSquare` prop to each `Square` component

## Visual Design
- **Color**: Light orange (`#ffcc80`) for distinguishable but subtle highlighting
- **Coverage**: Both origin (from) and destination (to) squares of the last move
- **Priority**: Lower than selected piece and possible moves, higher than default colors
- **Persistence**: Highlights remain until the next move is made

## Feature Behavior
- Highlights are automatically updated when a new move is made
- Works with all move types including:
  - Normal moves
  - Captures
  - Castling (king and rook destination squares)
  - En passant
  - Promotion
- No highlighting shown at the start of a new game (no moves made yet)
- Highlights are cleared/updated on undo moves

## Integration with Existing Features
- **Possible Moves**: Last move highlights have lower priority, so selected piece moves display correctly
- **Selected Piece**: Selected piece highlighting takes precedence over last move
- **Game Flow**: Seamlessly integrated with existing move-making logic
- **Performance**: Uses React.useMemo for efficient last move calculation

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Feature integrated without breaking existing functionality
- Works with the existing game flow and state management

## Next Steps
This completes the last move highlight feature. The implementation follows existing code patterns and maintains consistency with the app's visual design. The feature is production-ready and enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback about the most recent move.
